# ADB Library - adblib
> https://github.com/tananaev/adblib

## Overview

A Java library implementation of [the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) network protocol](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/adb/protocol.txt).

This project is a fork of the [original library](https://github.com/cgutman/AdbLib) developed by Cameron Gutman.

## Usage

Include dependency via Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'com.tananaev:adblib:1.3'
```
or Maven:
``` xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tananaev</groupId>
  <artifactId>adblib</artifactId>
  <version>1.3</version>
</dependency>
```

To be able to connect to the ADB daemon on Android phone, you need to enable it to listen to TCP connections. To do that, connect your phone via USB cable and run following adb command:
```
adb tcpip 5555
```

Disconnect USB cable before trying to connect using the library. Some phones have problems handling TCP connection when they are connected via USB as well.

More info about Android remote debugging can be found on the official [Android developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#wireless).

Sample library usage example:
``` java
Socket socket = new Socket("192.168.1.42", 5555); // put phone IP address here

AdbCrypto crypto = AdbCrypto.generateAdbKeyPair(new AdbBase64() {
    @Override
    public String encodeToString(byte[] data) {
        return DatatypeConverter.printBase64Binary(data);
    }
});

AdbConnection connection = AdbConnection.create(socket, crypto);
connection.connect();

AdbStream stream = connection.open("shell:logcat");

...
```
